## Computer Vision Course Projects
This repository contains four computer vision projects:  
#####1. Video processing. 
You are supposed to deal with a video, change the speed, binarize it and add a special watermark of you to it.  
Here I chose a video of the goal of Van Persie.
#####2. Medical image processing
This task requires me to count the number of a medical image from microscope and find the maximum as well as the minimum ones.  
I applied binaryzation, edge detecting and ellipse fitting in this project.
#####3. Camera calibrating  
In this task we are given several images of a chessboard, to detect the corner point of it, and then use this information to calibrating the image, reducing the distortion of the camera.
#####4. Face recognition
This task introduced us two algorithms of face detection, Eigenface (Based on PCA) as well as (Fisherface Based on LDA). By implemented them on different databased I also generated results and compared the performances.  
####As an extension, I studied the Laplacianface algorithm designed by Prof. Xiaofei He. 
####After studying deep learning, we can try to implement CNN on face recognition which can help us to do recognition beyond face subspace.
  
## Data Mining
This repository contains all data mining projects and assignments

## Infomation Visualization
The Information Visualization directory is the final team project for the class. The project was based on the VAST 2014, MiniChallenge 1.

## Java Projects
There are two simple Java projects here.
