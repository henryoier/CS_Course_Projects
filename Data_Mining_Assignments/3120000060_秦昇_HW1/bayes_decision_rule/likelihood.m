%LIKELIHOOD Different Class Feature Liklihood 
%
%   INPUT:  x, features of different class, C-By-N vector
%           C is the number of classes, N is the number of different feature
%
%   OUTPUT: l,  likelihood of each feature(from smallest feature to biggest feature) given by each class, C-By-N matrix
%

% Your code HERE
n = sum(x,2);
for k=1:C
    l(k,:)=x(k,:)/n(k);
